# Which Cocktail?

This engaging web application is designed to help users discover new cocktails by entering a cocktail name and retrieving relevant information such as the cocktail's name, a photo, and mixing instructions. Users can enter different cocktail names, including multi-word names like "moscow mule," and the application will provide a random variant of the cocktail if multiple exist.

**Link to project:** TBD

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TheCocktailDB API

The front end of the application is built with HTML and styled with CSS for a clean and user-friendly interface. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and manage API requests to TheCocktailDB API, which provides cocktail data based on user input. When a user types the name of a cocktail and clicks the "Get Cocktail" button, a fetch request is sent to the API, and the application displays the cocktail name, an image, and preparation instructions dynamically on the page.

## Optimizations

- Enhanced User Interface: Future updates could include advanced styling and animations to make the interface more engaging.

- Extended Cocktail Information: Additional cocktail details such as ingredients, glass type used, and garnish could be included to enrich the content.

- Error Handling Improvements: Implementing more robust error handling to provide clearer feedback when a search yields no results or the API fails to respond.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing this project provided substantial insights into working with external APIs and dynamically updating the DOM based on user input.
